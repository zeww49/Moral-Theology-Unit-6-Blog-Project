        <p>
          If we say we believe in human dignity, then we can’t treat classmates like they’re “less than.”
          The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) publicly states that all people are created in the image of God and commits to
          welcome, acceptance, and inclusion of transgender and nonbinary people — and to standing against discrimination and violence. <strong>[1]</strong>
        </p>

        <div class="evidence">
          <strong>Evidence (faith-based):</strong>
          PC(USA)’s statement is a real example of a church putting dignity into action, not just saying “be nice.”
          They also describe formal advocacy work (an Advocacy Committee for LGBTQIA+ Equity). <strong>[1]</strong>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Thinking Critically:</strong>
          Someone might say, “Churches shouldn’t talk about this.” But protecting people from discrimination and violence
          is a basic moral responsibility — not “politics.”

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <p>
          Solidarity means we don’t ignore harm just because it’s happening to someone else.
          According to The Trevor Project’s 2021 research brief, <strong>52%</strong> of LGBTQ youth in middle/high school reported being bullied
          in the past year. <strong>[4]</strong>

          <strong>Thinking Critically:</strong>
          People say “just ignore it.” But if half of LGBTQ students are experiencing bullying, ignoring it clearly isn’t working.

        <h2>Post 3 — What actually helps: affirming environments reduce bullying</h2>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <p>
          Students have a right to learn without harassment, and schools have a responsibility to protect students.
          Trevor Project data shows LGBTQ students in schools they describe as LGBTQ-affirming reported being bullied at a lower rate
          than those in non-affirming schools (<strong>46% vs 57%</strong>). <strong>[4]</strong>

        <div class="evidence">
          <strong>Why this supports CST:</strong>
          CST isn’t only “private beliefs.” It includes responsibility for the common good. If a school climate can reduce bullying,
          then building that climate is a serious responsibility.
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Thinking Critically:</strong>
          Someone might argue “affirming schools are pushing an agenda.” But the measurable outcome here is less bullying.
          Safety and dignity aren’t an “agenda.”

        <h2>Post 4 — Why affirming faith spaces matter (real research example)</h2>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <p>
          CST teaches we should pay special attention to people who are more likely to face harm or exclusion.
          A peer-reviewed study on LGBT-affirming churches (nine focus groups, <strong>N=52</strong>) found themes like
          acceptance and emotional healing, and that affirming churches can be opportunities to promote community well-being. <strong>[2]</strong>
        </p>

        <div class="evidence">
          <strong>Evidence (research-based):</strong>
          The study doesn’t claim every experience is perfect — some participants still preferred traditional churches —
          but it shows affirming spaces can offer real support and healing for LGBTQ people. <strong>[2]</strong>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Thinking Critically:</strong>
          Some people will say, “If someone feels rejected, they should just find another space.”
          But the CST idea here is: communities should reduce exclusion, not outsource people’s dignity somewhere else.

        <h2>Post 5 — The common good: belonging improves the whole school</h2>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <p>
          The common good means everyone benefits when the community is safer and healthier.
          The Trevor Project brief reports that LGBTQ students who were bullied had <strong>three times greater odds</strong> of attempting suicide
          in the past year (aOR = 3.06). <strong>[4]</strong>
        </p>

        <div class="evidence">
          <strong>So what should students do?</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Shut down slurs/jokes (even “as a joke” normalizes it).</li>
            <li>Report harassment (screenshots help if it’s online).</li>
            <li>Be a safe person: check on classmates privately.</li>
            <li>Support clubs, counselors, and policies that reduce bullying.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Thinking Critically:</strong>
          Even if people disagree on theology, most people agree students shouldn’t be harassed.
          If the outcome is less bullying and less risk, the common good is served.
